LOOP BEGIN at /usr/include/c++/8/bits/stl_tree.h(1851,6) inlined into ../src/adapt_repartition.cpp(8143,12)
   remark #15333: loop was not vectorized: exception handling for a call prevents vectorization   [ /usr/include/c++/8/ext/new_allocator.h(111,27) ]
LOOP END

LOOP BEGIN at /usr/include/c++/8/bits/stl_tree.h(114,7) inlined into ../src/adapt_repartition.cpp(8143,12)
   remark #15521: loop was not vectorized: loop control variable was not identified. Explicitly compute the iteration count before executing the loop or try using canonical loop form from OpenMP specification
LOOP END
